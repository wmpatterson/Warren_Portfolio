Data analytics porfolio projects

This project folder includes a few projects I have completed to demonstrate my skills and abilities in data analytics.

## Fiftyville.sql ##
This SQL log is taken from a problem set which was a part of the Harvard CS50 course. I was tasked with querying a relational database of tables to find out the culprit of a crime, their accomplice and the city they fled to. This project allowed me to practise my use of joins and CTEs in particular!

## 911 EDA ##
This Jupyter notebook contains some exploratory data modification and analysis of a 911 calls dataset. Specifically, I utilised seaborn to plot some important count data and also timeseries, including looking at associations through heat and cluster maps.
